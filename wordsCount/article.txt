The difficulty with the list representation arises from the need to scan
to find the end of the list. The reason we need to scan is that, although
the standard way of representing a list as a chain of pairs readily
provides us with a pointer to the beginning of the list, it gives us no
easily accessible pointer to the end. The modification that avoids the
drawback is to represent the queue as a list, together with an additional
pointer that indicates the final pair in the list. That way, when we go to
insert an item, we can consult the rear pointer and so avoid scanning the
list.
